## Game of Life Simulator


This is a very simple game of life simulator. You can draw the pixels by left and delete them by right click. (the middle click will clear the whole canvas).

I have utilized a matrix based update rule that makes the calculation time extremely faster (from order of O(N^2) to O(N))
