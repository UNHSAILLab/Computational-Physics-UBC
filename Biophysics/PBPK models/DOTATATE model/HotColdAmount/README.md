
This project demonstrates the competition between hot and cold molecules in 
the body. More cold molecules will occupy the free receptors and thus fewer
hot molecules will get binded and the total delivered dose will decrease

To run the model:
    run main.m file


This folder contains following files:

HotColdAmount.sbproj: 
    this file is the simbiology project. you can open this in the matlab
    simbiology and then you will have access to the model and the programs
    for model analysis.

HotColdAmount_program.m:
    to run the simulation and see the results you can open the HotColdAmount.sbproj
    in simbiology and run the model. This file contains the matlab file and
    cold of that. So you can run this function and it will run the model

HotColdAmount_args.mat:
    This is the arguments that we need to pass to HotColdAmount.m function 
    to run the simulation and generate the results

main.m:
    this file will run the simulation and generate the results in form of 
    plots
