## Strange Squares:

Strange Squares is the name that I gave to this discovery that I had by accident.

Discoveries:
1. Eye frame rate changes when you state at objects
2. dynamic image gets freezed when you are looking at a moving object while the dynamic image is at the corner of your vision field (or vise versa, i.e. when you stare at a stationary object and move the dynamic image while it is at the corner of your vision field.

The figure consist of many white and black squares that at each time step one lattice site is chossen randomly and its color is changed.

The strange thing is that when you stare at the dynamic image you can clearly see the fluctuation. But when you put the dynamic image at the corner of your vision field, and then move your eye, the fluctuating image gets stable!! That was very surpursing for me. Before that, I had been observing that the rate of fluctuation is different when you stare at the dynamic image in comparision with the situation when the image is at the corner of you vision field. But the complete freeze of the image was something that I was not expecting at all!!

I did more experiments and I found some other ways to ilustrate that too. 
The other method is when you put the dynamic image at the corner of your vision field and then stare at something else (like a word on a webpage) on monitor and scroll the webpage. 
Or more controlled version of it is when you state at a point on your monitor and change the location of dynamic image with your mouse.


By running this code, you will get the dynmaic image and you can start experimenting with that.
